# ReSeebo
### By: Kenneth Loquinte, Ryan Sarabia

Paper receipts post-transactions are very wasteful. Sometimes, these receipts are thrown away immediately. 
The application provides an alternative option to receive these receipts in digital format. 
The main function of the ReSeebo application is a QR code scanner which scans code generated by a merchant. 
After scanning, the application would convert the code into a digital receipt which contains important information such as merchant name, items, total price, date, etc. 
The application also acts as a receipt manager where users are able to view all receipts they have saved and use filters to easily search for specific receipts; 
receipts can also be deleted. Furthermore, receipts can be given tags in order to group them.

## QR Code Samples

We have provided QR codes to test the app. These QR codes are assumed to be from merchants that the user made a transaction with.
